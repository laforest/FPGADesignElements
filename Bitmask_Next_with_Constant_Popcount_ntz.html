<h1>Bitmask: Next with Constant Popcount (via Number of Trailing Zeros)</h1>
<p>Credit: <a href="./reading.html#Warren2013">Hacker's Delight</a>, Section 2-1: Manipulating Rightmost Bits, "A Novel Application"</p>
<p>Given a bitmask, gives the next bitmask, in lexicographic order (a.k.a.
 strictly incrementing order), with the same number of bits set (a.k.a. same
 population count). For example: 00100011 -&gt; 00100101.</p>
<p>Modified here to wraparound correctly at the end of the word, which allows
 you to start with any given bitmask, then know you have tried all possible
 cases when the next bitmask is identical to the starting bitmask.  This
 property avoids having to calculate n-choose-k (for a k-bit bitmask in an
 n-bit word) as a count, or have to detect and handle the highest-valued
 bitmask (i.e.: 11100000) as a special case.</p>
<p>Implementation, for x -&gt; y:</p>
<ul>
<li>s = x &amp; -x</li>
<li>r = s + x</li>
<li>c = carry(s + x)</li>
<li>y = r | [((x^r) &gt;&gt; (2-2c)) / s]</li>
</ul>
<p>While this version requires a division (unlike the <a href="./Bitmask_Next_with_Constant_Popcount_pop.html">popcount-based
 version</a>), the divisor (s)
 is always a power-of-two (<a href="./Bitmask_Isolate_Rightmost_1_Bit.v">Bitmask: Isolate Rightmost
 1 Bit</a>), so the (unsigned) division
 simplifies to a logical shift right by log<sub>2</sub>(s). The two
 consecutive logical shift right can now be combined or commuted, and
 ultimately reduce to a shift by the number of trailing zeros (ntz), with a
 correction of 2 or 0:</p>
<ul>
<li>y = r | [((x^r) &gt;&gt; (2-2c)) &gt;&gt; log<sub>2</sub>(s)]</li>
<li>y = r | (x^r) &gt;&gt; [(2-2c) + log<sub>2</sub>(s)]</li>
<li>y = r | (x^r) &gt;&gt; [(2-2c) + ntz(x)]</li>
</ul>
<p>We will use the first above form since it doesn't require another adder of
 yet another bit width (log<sub>2</sub>(WORD_WIDTH)) which complicates
 writing clean Verilog, and the correction shift is predictable: either by
 2 or zero, so we can provide both, select one, and feed it to the second,
 data-dependent shift.</p>
<p>While this version replaces the relatively large <a href="./Population_Count.html">Population
 Count</a> module with the much smaller <a href="./Logarithm_of_Powers_of_Two.html">Logarithm of
 Powers of Two</a> module, it does require
 a full-word variable bit-shift, which costs more. I don't yet know whether
 this is a good tradeoff for speed or area.</p>

<pre>
`default_nettype none

module <a href="./Bitmask_Next_with_Constant_Popcount_ntz.html">Bitmask_Next_with_Constant_Popcount_ntz</a>
#(
    parameter WORD_WIDTH = 0
)
(
    input   wire    [WORD_WIDTH-1:0]    word_in,
    output  reg     [WORD_WIDTH-1:0]    word_out
);
</pre>

<p>First, let's define some constants used throughout. Rather than expect
 the simulator/synthesizer to get the Verilog spec right and extend
 integers correctly, we defensively specify the entire word.</p>

<pre>
    localparam WORD_ZERO = {WORD_WIDTH{1'b0}};

    initial begin
        word_out = WORD_ZERO;
    end
</pre>

<p>Compute <code>s</code>: the least-significant bit set in the bitmask.</p>

<pre>
    wire [WORD_WIDTH-1:0] smallest;

    <a href="./Bitmask_Isolate_Rightmost_1_Bit.html">Bitmask_Isolate_Rightmost_1_Bit</a>
    #(
        .WORD_WIDTH (WORD_WIDTH)
    )
    find_smallest
    (
        .word_in    (word_in),
        .word_out   (smallest)
    );
</pre>

<p>Compute <code>r</code>: add that least-significant bit to the input, causing any run
 of consecutive 1 bits at the right to ripple up into the next 0 bit. (e.g.:
 1001100 -&gt; 1010000)</p>
<p>Compute <code>c</code>: save the carry-out to later deal with the case where the
 consecutive 1 bits were at the left end of the word and rippled up into the
 carry out. In this case, we want to remove a correction to the shift amount
 described later.</p>

<pre>
    wire [WORD_WIDTH-1:0]   ripple;
    wire                    ripple_carry_out;

    <a href="./Adder_Subtractor_Binary.html">Adder_Subtractor_Binary</a>
    #(
        .WORD_WIDTH (WORD_WIDTH)
    )
    calc_ripple
    (
        .add_sub    (1'b0), // 0/1 -> A+B/A-B
        .carry_in   (1'b0),
        .A_in       (word_in),
        .B_in       (smallest),
        .sum_out    (ripple),
        .carry_out  (ripple_carry_out)
    );
</pre>

<p>Compute <code>x^r</code>: find the bits which changed after the ripple
 addition. Any changed bits are on the right side of the ripple: the left
 side is always unchanged, except at the limit case where the carry out is
 set.</p>

<pre>
    reg [WORD_WIDTH-1:0] changed_bits = WORD_ZERO;

    always @(*) begin
        changed_bits = word_in ^ ripple;
    end
</pre>

<p>We need a correction to the upcoming right shift: If we have not reached
 the left end of the word, then we need an extra right shift of two, else of
 zero.  Normally, after the ripple, we shift right once to discard the
 now-cleared least-significant set bit, and once more to bring the new
 least-significant set bit into the position of that original
 least-significant set bit. If we rippled right up into the carry bit, then
 no new least-significant set bit is created, so we don't have anything to
 discard and so we don't shift left here.</p>

<pre>
    reg [WORD_WIDTH-1:0] changed_bits_corrected = WORD_ZERO;

    always @(*) begin
        changed_bits_corrected = (ripple_carry_out == 1'b1) ? changed_bits : changed_bits >> 2;
    end
</pre>

<p>Later, we will need to re-align our changed bits back to the right (plus
 any correction), so let's find out the index of the original
 least-significant set bit.</p>

<pre>
    wire [WORD_WIDTH-1:0] final_shift_amount;

    <a href="./Logarithm_of_Powers_of_Two.html">Logarithm_of_Powers_of_Two</a>
    #(
        .WORD_WIDTH             (WORD_WIDTH)
    )
    calc_final_shift_amount
    (
        .one_hot_in             (smallest),
        .logarithm_out          (final_shift_amount),
        // verilator lint_off PINCONNECTEMPTY
        .logarithm_undefined    ()
        // verilator lint_on  PINCONNECTEMPTY
    );
</pre>

<p>Now we shift the post-ripple changed bits (x^r) back to the right end of
 the word (plus correction), giving us the next sequence of changed bits
 with the same number of bits set.</p>

<pre>
    wire [WORD_WIDTH-1:0] changed_bits_shifted; 

    <a href="./Bit_Shifter.html">Bit_Shifter</a>
    #(
        .WORD_WIDTH         (WORD_WIDTH)
    )
    move_changed_bits
    (
        .word_in_left       (WORD_ZERO),
        .word_in            (changed_bits_corrected),
        .word_in_right      (WORD_ZERO),

        .shift_amount       (final_shift_amount),
        .shift_direction    (1'b1), // 0/1 -> left/right

        // verilator lint_off PINCONNECTEMPTY
        .word_out_left      (),
        .word_out           (changed_bits_shifted),
        .word_out_right     ()
        // verilator lint_on  PINCONNECTEMPTY
    );
</pre>

<p>Finally, we OR the rippled bits (which contains the unchanged left-most
 part, plus the newly set/cleared ripple bits) with the changed bits lost to
 the initial ripple (if any). We now have the next bitmask with the same
 number of set bits, in strict incrementing order (a.k.a. lexicographic
 order).</p>

<pre>
    always @(*) begin
        word_out = ripple | changed_bits_shifted;
    end

endmodule

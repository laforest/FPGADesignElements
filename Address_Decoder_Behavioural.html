<h1>Address Decoder (Behavioural)</h1>
<p>A programmable address decoder. Works for any address range at any starting
 point, <em>and the base and bound addresses can be changed at runtime</em>.  We
 express this behaviourally with two unsigned integer comparisons to check
 if the address lies between the base and bound of a range, inclusively.</p>
<p>This decoder scales to larger address ranges (20 bits or more) without
 hitting any Verilog implementation vector width limits or requiring long
 optimization of enormous netlists, as with the <a href="./Address_Decoder_Static.html">Static Address
 Decoder</a>.</p>
<p>How this circuit synthesizes depends on your CAD tool. In the past, I saw
 this code synthesize to the expected arithmetic comparisons via
 subtraction, but a more recent version of the same CAD tool synthesizes to
 log<sub>2</sub>(ADDR_WIDTH) levels of LUT logic. <em>But it is unclear if that
 will be faster than arithmetic circuitry.</em> And of course, if you make the
 base and bound addresses constant, the logic will optimize further towards
 its minimal form.</p>
<p>The base, bound, and input addresses all use the same width, which avoids
 the need for selecting parts of vectors and makes the enclosing code
 cleaner and more general.</p>
<p><strong>This is the implementation I recommend for general use.</strong> You can force
 a non-arithmetic implementation (but with a fixed range) by using the
 Static Address Decoder, or conversely, you can force an arithmetic
 implementation by using the <a href="./Address_Decoder_Arithmetic.html">Arithmetic Address
 Decoder</a>.</p>

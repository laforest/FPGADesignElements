<h1>Outline</h1>

<p>This book provides a reference library of fundamental digital logic design
elements, along with standards for <a href="./verilog.html">Verilog coding</a>
and <a href="./system.html">system design</a>. Think of it as a hardware analog
to the C Standard Library ("libc") and its documentation.</p>

<p>The design elements are grouped into categories (e.g.: Boolean Logic,
Synchronous Logic, Integer Arithmetic, etc...). Each category entry implements
and explains a specific design element, starting with the most basic ones
(including ones meant solely for beginner's education rather than serious use),
and gradually increase in complexity up to complete interfaces and
special-purpose engines built using a common design form which heavily re-use
other design elements.</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> The module definitions are, by design, not usable as-is.
Unless the design requires some minimum or constant value, all module
parameters have a default value of 0 or an empty string. This is intentional,
so when a user forgets to set a parameter when instantiating a module,
synthesis will (almost always) fail, and linting also. Putting usable default
values in the module definitions might not get noticed and cause bugs. This
means the modules are not synthesizable as defined, but must be instantiated
separately to set the parameters, which is what one normally does anyway.

</div>

<p>Each entry web page is <a href="./tools.html">generated directly</a> from
the design element Verilog source, and you can find a link to the source at the
top of each page.  Comments form the text body, while the code is placed in
bordered preformatted text blocks.</p>

<p>To obtain your own local copy of the book: <code>git clone
https://github.com/laforest/FPGADesignElements.git</code> then access <a
href="./index.html">./index.html</a> from your favourite browser.  All Verilog
sources and other files are in one directory, so you can use it as a library in
your CAD tools by simply importing all Verilog files.  See the <a
href="./legal.html">license and disclaimer</a> for the legal details, but
overall, you are free to use this book as you please.</p>

<p>Although the design elements in this book are written in Verilog-2001 (for
portability, better software support, and fine control of the synthesis), I
expect there is very little code which could not be trivially translated into
your Hardware Description Language of choice. I also expect the design elements
themselves to be universal and language-agnostic.<p>

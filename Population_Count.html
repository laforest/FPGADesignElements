<h1>Population Count (a.k.a. Hamming Weight)</h1>
<p>Returns the number of bits set in the input word.  The popcount is always
 log<sub>2</sub>(N)+1 bits wide given an N-bit input word.  (e.g.: a 32-bit
 word has a 6-bit popcount, so you can represent the integer "32")</p>
<p>The algorithm is straightforward: split the input word into bit pairs and
 count the number of bits set in each pair using a lookup table, then extend
 each count to log<sub>2</sub>(N)+1 bits, and sum all the counts one after
 the other, which expresses a chain of (N/2)-1 small adders (e.g.: 15 6-bit
 adders for a 32-bit input word) rather than the obvious tree of adders,
 which would require more difficult, recursive code. However, the CAD tool
 can reduce the logic (most of the added bits are constant zeros) and
 generate a tree of LUTs and adders with a carry-chain log<sub>2</sub>(N)+1
 bits long, which is the length of the expected final adder were this a tree
 of adders.</p>
<p>There are many applications of population count. Think of it as mapping
 bitmasks to the integers, allowing us to use arithmetic operations to
 determine properties.</p>
<h2>Leaning on Logic Optimization to Reduce User Errors</h2>
<p>When I originally wrote this, the POPCOUNT_WIDTH was a module parameter
 rather than being calculated internally, as the enclosing module needs to
 know the width of the output, so it should calculate log<sub>2</sub>(N)+1
 and pass it to this module. If the value is smaller than that, then the
 missing bits will not be computed. If the value is larger, the extra bits
 will be always zero.</p>
<p>However, it turns out that it's error-prone to expect the user to remember
 that the output width should be log<sub>2</sub>(N)+1 and not
 log<sub>2</sub>(N). It is easier to leave the output width at WORD_WIDTH as
 this simplifies code and the post-elaboration diagram, and the logic
 optimization of the successive additions automatically infers the
 log<sub>2</sub>(N)+1 output width and eliminates the redundant logic.
 I left the code as-is, and hardwired the POPCOUNT_WIDTH parameter instead.</p>
<h2>Portability and Readability</h2>
<p>This implementation depends heavily on Verilog's vector part select
 operation, which might cause difficulties when porting to other HDLs, and
 also means you should read it carefully as some lines are long and have
 a lot of bits being moved around between vectors, but this design choice
 also makes the code easily parameterizable.</p>

<pre>
`default_nettype none

module <a href="./Population_Count.html">Population_Count</a>
#(
    parameter WORD_WIDTH        = 0,

    // Don't set at instantiation (see above)
    parameter POPCOUNT_WIDTH    = WORD_WIDTH
)
(
    input   wire    [WORD_WIDTH-1:0]        word_in,
    output  reg     [POPCOUNT_WIDTH-1:0]    count_out
);

    initial begin
        count_out = {POPCOUNT_WIDTH{1'b0}};
    end
</pre>

<p>This part of the code never changes regardless of input word width, so to
 keep the code concise, I'll break the rule of always naming constants and
 instead use the literals: a 4-entry table of 2-bit values, converting the
 integer described by a pair of bits into an integer describing the number
 of bits set in that pair of bits (the "paircount"). Since both have 2 bits,
 we can conveniently just replace the input bit pairs by their paircounts.
 We put a ramstyle attribute to tell the CAD tool this should NOT be
 synthesized as a memory, but just as LUT logic. It works without it, but
 I have seen my CAD tool randomly decide to use Block RAM instead.</p>

<pre>
    (* ramstyle = "logic" *)        // Quartus
    (* ram_style = "distributed" *) // Vivado

    reg [1:0] popcount2bits [0:3];

    initial begin
        popcount2bits[0] = 2'd0;
        popcount2bits[1] = 2'd1;
        popcount2bits[2] = 2'd1;
        popcount2bits[3] = 2'd2;
    end
</pre>

<p>Then let's calculate how many pairs of bits we have to process, and the
 zero-padding we will use to extend them to POPCOUNT_WIDTH, so all the
 adders work on the same number of bits. Using the maximum number of
 bits is a lot easier than figuring out the necessary adder bit width at
 each step, and since the padding is constant zero, it wil be optimized
 away during synthesis.</p>

<pre>
    localparam PAIR_COUNT       = WORD_WIDTH / 2;
    localparam PAIR_WORD_WIDTH  = PAIR_COUNT * 2;
    localparam PAD_WIDTH        = POPCOUNT_WIDTH - 2;
    localparam PAD              = {PAD_WIDTH{1'b0}};
</pre>

<p>Then define our working space: a vector of paircounts holding all bit
 pairs (might be less than WORD_WIDTH if its value is odd), and
 a vector of popcount words, one popcount for each paircount. We will
 accumulate popcounts and paircounts into each successive popcount word,
 and the last popcount will hold our final result.</p>
<p>Veril*tor can't quite see what we're doing here, so we tell it to ignore
 the apparent combinational loop. (The "*" is so that program doesn't see
 this comment as an erroneous directive.)</p>

<pre>
    reg [PAIR_WORD_WIDTH-1:0]               paircount   = {PAIR_WORD_WIDTH{1'b0}};
    // verilator lint_off UNOPTFLAT
    reg [(POPCOUNT_WIDTH*PAIR_COUNT)-1:0]   popcount    = {POPCOUNT_WIDTH*PAIR_COUNT{1'b0}};
    // verilator lint_on  UNOPTFLAT
</pre>

<p>Finally, if WORD_WIDTH is odd, we will have to account for the last bit not
 in a pair. So let's compute that flag now.</p>

<pre>
    localparam WORD_WIDTH_IS_ODD = (WORD_WIDTH % 2) == 1;
</pre>

<p>Translate the initial bit pair into a paircount and then pad it into
 a popcount value. Doing this also peels out the first iteration of the
 following loop so we can refer to the previous loop index without having
 a negative number (which is not allowed).</p>

<pre>
    integer i;

    always @(*) begin
        paircount[0 +: 2]               = popcount2bits[word_in[0 +: 2]];
        popcount[0 +: POPCOUNT_WIDTH]   = {PAD,paircount[0 +: 2]};
</pre>

<p>Now repeat for all remaining bit pairs, but also accumulate the popcount
 from the previous iteration.  Note the start index due to the peeled-out
 first iteration.</p>

<pre>
        for(i=1; i < PAIR_COUNT; i=i+1) begin : per_paircount
            paircount[2*i +: 2]                          = popcount2bits[word_in[2*i +: 2]];
            popcount[POPCOUNT_WIDTH*i +: POPCOUNT_WIDTH] = {PAD,paircount[2*i +: 2]} + popcount[POPCOUNT_WIDTH*(i-1) +: POPCOUNT_WIDTH];
        end
</pre>

<p>If the input word width was odd, pad up the last bit not in a pair to the
 popcount width and add it to the last popcount.</p>

<pre>
        if (WORD_WIDTH_IS_ODD == 1'b1) begin
            popcount[POPCOUNT_WIDTH*(PAIR_COUNT-1) +: POPCOUNT_WIDTH] = popcount[POPCOUNT_WIDTH*(PAIR_COUNT-1) +: POPCOUNT_WIDTH] + {{POPCOUNT_WIDTH-1{1'b0}},word_in[WORD_WIDTH-1]};
        end
</pre>

<p>Then the last popcount is the total for the whole input word.</p>

<pre>
        count_out = popcount[POPCOUNT_WIDTH*(PAIR_COUNT-1) +: POPCOUNT_WIDTH];
    end

endmodule

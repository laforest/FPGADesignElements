<h1>Annuller (Both Kinds)</h1>
<p>Takes in a word-wide signal, and passes it through, unless <code>annul</code> is high,
 then the signal is gated to zero.  We put something this simple into
 a module since it conveys design intent (e.g.: "turn this opcode into
 a no-op"), and avoids an RTL schematic cluttered with a bunch of gates.</p>
<p>Annulling shows up in many designs: instead of using a multiplexer, we can
 selectively annul all but one input and OR-reduce to a result, which uses
 the final LUTs more efficiently. 
 While this is how a multiplexer works internally, breaking it open like
 this allows us to control the pipelining directly (which is relevant if you
 are going to have a lot of inputs), and allows us to select alternative
 conflict resolutions if two or more inputs remain after annulling:</p>
<ul>
<li>reduce them to a single result using AND/OR/XOR,</li>
<li>feed them to an arbiter so you can process each remaining input in sequence,</li>
<li>have multiple final stages do different things in parallel with the remaining inputs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, Annulling allows us to easily think about calculating multiple
 things in parallel and keeping only the results we want. However, throwing
 away work increases performance at the expense of efficiency. Try to use
 the lost information if you can.</p>
<h2>Implementation Options</h2>
<p>Some experimentation by others has shown that CAD tools will pattern-match
 on the description of the gating operation, resulting in different
 synth results depending on whether you describe the signal gating using
 a multiplexer or an AND gate. The synthesized logic may end up using the
 reset/clear pin of a flip-flop, or may create AND-gate logic after the
 flip-flop, which then gets folded into other LUT logic. Thus, both
 implementation are available via the <code>IMPLEMENTATION</code> parameter.</p>
<p>The Annuller implementation does not generally matter. However, on FPGAs, the
 reset/clear signal is common to all flip-flops in a group (<em>known as a CLB
 (Common Logic Block) for Xilinx, or a LAB (Logic Array block) for Intel</em>).
 Thus, flip-flops driven by different reset/clear logic cannot be packed
 together, though since an Annuller applies the same reset/clear logic to
 all signals, they should pack normally.</p>
<p>Register retiming may also be affected, again due to the reset/clear
 signals, but again, this is a minor problem if one at all. Assume things
 are fine, and check your synthesis results if a bottleneck appears.</p>

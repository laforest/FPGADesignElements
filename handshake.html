<h1>Rules for Ready/Valid Handshakes</h1>

<p>from <a href="./index.html">FPGA Design Elements</a> by <a href="http://fpgacpu.ca/">Charles Eric LaForest, PhD.</a>

<p>Ready/valid handshakes are a flexible and lightweight way to connect and
control modules in composable ways, but as I designed more complex modules, I
found some corner cases I couldn't quite fit into the ready/valid handshake
model, and some designs started not composing well because I was implementing
the handshakes inconsistently. So I worked out a set of rules.

<p>I based these rules on those in the AMBA AXI4 Specification, Chapter A3,
"Single Interface Requirements", and expanded on their meaning and
consequences. I have replaced the inappropriate "master/slave" terminology with
"source/destination", correspondingly, when refering to handshake interfaces.

<h2>Interfaces</h2>

<p>There are two complementary interface types: <em>source</em> and
<em>destination</em>. Both interfaces have three signals: valid, ready, and
data. Ready and valid are single-bit signals, and the data signal is of
arbitrary width. <b>All signals are synchronous to the rising edge of the
clock</b>.

<ul>
<li>The <em>source</em> interface outputs valid and data, and takes ready as input.
<li>The <em>destination</em> interface outputs ready, and receives valid and data.
</ul>

<p>A connection always goes from the source interface to the destination
interface.  Other pairings cannot work.

<h3>Loops</h3>

<p>There must be no combinational paths from input to output signals in the
source interface (ready to valid), nor in the destination interface (valid to
ready). Otherwise combinational loops will form when connecting interfaces.

<p>Even if only one type of interface has a loop, thus avoiding combinational
loops, the remaining combinational path will go from one interface to the other
and back to the first, which will cause a long delay. This delay will both
limit your design clock frequency and make placement and routing of the modules
connected by these interfaces more difficult. <em>It is not worth saving a
cycle of latency here at the expense of the performance of the rest of the
design.</em> Proper handshake interface design and pipelining will avoid this
extra cycle of latency, while <em>improving</em> clock frequency and P&amp;R.

<h2>Handshake Procedure</h2> 

<p>At any time, the source interface raises <em>and holds steady</em> valid
when data is available, and the destination interface raises ready only when it
can accept more data. When both valid and ready are high, the handshake is
complete, the destination interface accepts the data in the same cycle, and the
ready and valid outputs change state if necessary. 

<p>The destination interface can freely assert and deassert ready at any time.
However, it is beneficial to have the destination interface assert ready as
soon as it can accept data, before the source interface asserts valid, to
shorten handshakes to a single cycle. For the same reason, the source interface
should assert and hold steady valid as soon as it has data to send.

<p>After a handshake completes, the source interface drops valid if it has no
more data, otherwise it keeps valid high for the next handshake, which may
complete in the same clock cycle.  Similarly, the destination interface drops
ready if it cannot accept more data, otherwise it keeps ready high and can
complete the next handshake in the same clock cycle if valid is also high.

<h3>Incorrect Handshakes</h3>

<p>It is possible, although incorrect, to have the destination interface accept
data at the moment the source interface asserts valid, then signal ready to
complete the handshake, after the data is processed, to move the source
interface to the next data item. 

<p>Although this is legal and will work, it obscures the operation of the
logic, and breaks pipelining since the source interface cannot begin processing
and presenting the next data item concurrently with the destination interface
processing the current data item. If the source and destination processing
times are equal, which is the optimum when pipelining, this incorrect handshake
will halve the throughput instead of doubling it! 

<h3>Sampling Changing Data</h3>

<p>Typically, the source interface holds data steady alongside valid, changing
data only after the handshake completes. Any data value outside of the clock
cycle when the handshake completes is lost. It is allowable to have data be a
continuously changing value, synchronously to the clock, which will get sampled
whenever a handshake completes. 

<p>Sampling changing data is best done by having the source interface hold
valid high, while the destination interface asserts ready at an interval.  The
opposite method of sampling where the source interface periodically asserts
valid does not guarantee a predictable sampling interval, since it depends on
the destination interface having already asserted ready.

<h3>Avoiding Deadlocks and Livelocks</h3>

<p>We must constrain the behaviour of the valid and ready signals to prevent
deadlocks, where the source and destination interfaces wait forever for
eachother to respond, and to prevent livelocks, where both interfaces are
responding but the handshake never completes.

<p>To prevent deadlocks, the source interface must not wait until the
destination interface asserts ready before asserting valid, while the
destination interface can wait for the source interface to assert valid before
asserting ready. This waiting will extend the handshake to two cycles,
completing in the second cycle, but has applications where we want to
selectively complete handshakes from multiple source interfaces (e.g.: an
arbiter).

<p>To prevent livelocks, when the source interface asserts valid <em>it must
remain asserted until the handshake completes</em>, else we could end up in a
situation where the source interface temporarily asserts valid and the
destination interface temporarily asserts ready, but they never coincide to
complete the handshake.

<h2>Reset</h2>

<p>The reset signal to modules with source and/or destination interfaces can be
active high or low, may assert asynchronously, but must deassert synchronously.
However, using an active high reset limits the amount of inverted logic to
read, which keeps the logic clearer. <em>Also, I strongly recommend using a
fully synchronous reset since an asynchronous reset will inhibit register
retiming.</em> Any latch holding state inside the source or destination
interface must be reset, else the interface may remain in the wrong state after
reset (e.g. the source interface signalling that data is valid when there isn't
any).

<h2>Internal State</h2>

<p>Any internal state of a module which affects a source or destination
interface must only ever change in the same cycle as a <em>completed</em>
handshake, when both ready and valid are raised together. Otherwise, data may
be lost.

<p>For example, if you are counting down words in a packet passing through a
source interface, and you change state as soon as the counter reaches zero, you
will lose the last packet word if, by coincidence, the ready signal of the
destination interface goes low at the same time as the counter reaches zero. By
the time the destination interface raises ready, the source interface has
already moved on to the next packet and the previous data word has been lost,
corrupting the previous packet and all following packets.

<p>Thus, as a rule, define a line of code like this one:

<pre>
    always @(*) begin
        data_transfer = (ready == 1'b1) && (valid == 1'b1);
    end
</pre>

and use it to gate any state transitions that affect a source or destination
interface.

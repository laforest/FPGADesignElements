//# Pulse Divider

// Outputs a single-cycle high pulse when `divisor` input pulses have been
// received, thus dividing their number. For example, if `divisor` is 3,
// then:

// * 9 input pulses will produce 3 output pulses
// * 5 input pulses will produce 1 output pulse
// * 7 input pulses will produce 2 output pulses

// Pulses do not have to be distinct: holding the input high for a number of
// clock cycles will have the same effect as the same number of separate,
// single-cycle pulses.

// The output pulse occurs in the same cycle as the input pulse, which means
// there is a combinational path from `pulses_in` to `pulse_out`. This is
// necessary to avoid a cycle of latency between an input pulse arriving and
// signalling that it is a multiple of `divisor`. (e.g. signalling that the
// current load fills the last empty space in a buffer).

// The `divisor` is reloaded automatically after each output pulse. Any
// changes to the `divisor` input before then do not affect the current pulse
// division. However, asserting `restart` for one cycle will force the
// `divisor` to reload and the pulse division to restart. Holding `restart`
// high will halt the pulse divider. A `restart` pulse is not required after
// startup.

// *Loading a `divisor` of zero will disable the output pulses, raises
// `div_by_zero`, and will load `divisor` every cycle until it becomes
// non-zero.* 

//## Uses

// * Signal when a number of events have happened (e.g.: counting loads into
// a pipeline or buffer)
// * Generate a periodic enable pulse derived from your main clock. (tie
// `pulses_in` to 1)
// * Perform integer division: the number of output pulses after your input
// pulses are done is the quotient, the number of input pulses you have to then
// provide to get one more output pulse is the remainder if less than
// `divisor`, else it's zero (i.e.: it's the remainder modulo `divisor`).

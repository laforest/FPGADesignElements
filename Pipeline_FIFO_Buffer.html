<h1>Pipeline FIFO Buffer</h1>
<p>Decouples two sides of a ready/valid handshake to allow back-to-back
 transfers without a combinational path between input and output, thus
 pipelining the path to improve concurrency and/or timing. <em>Any FIFO depth
 is allowed, not only powers-of-2.</em> The input-to-output latency is 2 cycles.
 <em>Can function as a Circular Buffer.</em></p>
<p>Since a FIFO buffer stores variable amounts of data, it will smooth out
 irregularities in the transfer rates of the input and output interfaces,
 and when used in pipeline loops, can store enough data to prevent
 artificial deadlocks (re: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahn_process_networks#Boundedness_of_channels">Kahn Process
 Networks</a>
 with bounded channels).</p>
<p><em>This module is a variation of the asynchronous <a href="./CDC_FIFO_Buffer.html">CDC FIFO
 Buffer</a>, directly derived from Clifford E.
 Cummings' <a
 href="http://www.sunburst-design.com/papers/CummingsSNUG2002SJ_FIFO1.pdf">Simulation
 and Synthesis Techniques for Asynchronous FIFO Design</a>, SNUG 2002, San
 Jose.</em></p>
<h2>Circular Buffer Mode</h2>
<p>Normally, a FIFO buffer that is full will not complete another input
 handshake until a data item has been read out. You can think of this as
 buffering the <em>earliest</em> values from the pipeline.</p>
<p>Setting <code>CIRCULAR_BUFFER</code> parameter to a non-zero value changes the
 behaviour at the input: the input handshake can always complete, discarding
 the oldest data already in the buffer even if it was never read out.  You
 can think of this as buffering the <em>latest</em> values from the pipeline.  This
 is a circular buffer.</p>
<p>However, data at the buffer output can only be read out <em>once</em>, as usual,
 until updated again by data from inside the buffer, possibly in the same
 clock cycle. Simultaneous input and output handshakes are possible in
 Circular Buffer Mode since <code>input_ready</code> no longer depends on the
 empty/full state of the buffer (which forces alternation of input and
 output handshakes), nor on the state of the output handshake (which is
 disallowed to prevent creating a combinational path between input and
 output).</p>
<h2>Parameters, Ports, and Initializations</h2>

module <a href="./Pipeline_FIFO_Buffer.html">Pipeline_FIFO_Buffer</a>
#(
    parameter WORD_WIDTH                = 0,
    parameter DEPTH                     = 0,

    output  reg                         input_ready,
    input   wire    [WORD_WIDTH-1:0]    input_data,

    output  wire                        output_valid,
    input   wire                        output_ready,
    output  wire    [WORD_WIDTH-1:0]    output_data
);

    initial begin
        input_ready = 1'b1; // Empty at start, so accept data
    end
</pre>

<h2>Constants</h2>
<p>From the FIFO <code>DEPTH</code>, we derive the bit width of the buffer addresses and
 construct the constants we work with.</p>

<pre>
    `include "<a href="./clog2_function.html">clog2_function</a>.vh"

    localparam WORD_ZERO    = {WORD_WIDTH{1'b0}};

    localparam ADDR_WIDTH   = clog2(DEPTH);
    localparam ADDR_ONE     = {{ADDR_WIDTH-1{1'b0}},1'b1};
    localparam ADDR_ZERO    = {ADDR_WIDTH{1'b0}};
    localparam ADDR_LAST    = DEPTH-1;
</pre>

<h2>Data Path</h2>
<p>The buffer itself is a <em>synchronous</em> dual-port memory: one write port to
 insert data, and one read port to concurrently remove data, both clocked.
 Typically this memory will be a dedicated Block RAM, but can also be built
 from LUT RAM if the width and depth are small, or even plain registers for
 very small cases. Set the <code>RAMSTYLE</code> parameter as required.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: write-forwarding logic is not necessary, since in normal mode
 there will never be a concurrent read and write to the same address, and in
 Circular Buffer Mode, a concurrent read and write to the same address (when
 the buffer is already full) always returns the stored data, not the data
 being written. Guide your CAD tool as necessary in each case about
 read/write address collisions, so you can obtain the highest possible
 operating frequency. </p>
<p>We initialize the read/write enables to zero, signifying an idle system.</p>

<h3>Read/Write Address Counters</h3>
<p>The buffer read and write addresses are stored in counters which both start
 at (and <code>clear</code> to) <code>ADDR_ZERO</code>.  Each counter can only increment by
 <code>ADDR_ONE</code> at each read or write, and will wrap around to <code>ADDR_ZERO</code> if
 incremented past a value of <code>DEPTH-1</code>, labelled as <code>ADDR_LAST</code> (<code>load</code>
 overrides <code>run</code>). *The depth can be any positive number, not only
 a power-of-2.</p>

<h3>Wrap-Around Bits</h3>
<p>To distinguish between the empty buffer and full buffer cases, which both
 identically show as equal read and write buffer addresses, we keep track of
 each time an address wraps around to zero by toggling a bit.  <em>The
 addresses never pass eachother.</em> </p>
<p>If the write address runs ahead of the read address enough to wrap-around
 and reach the read address from behind, the buffer is full and all writes
 to the buffer halt until after a read happens (except in Circular Buffer
 Mode). We detect this because the write address will have wrapped-around
 one more time than the read address, so their wrap-around bits will be
 different.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the read address catches up to the write address from behind,
 the buffer is empty and all reads halt until after a write happens.  In
 this case, the wrap-around bits are identical.</p>

        .data_out       (buffer_read_addr_wrap_around)
    );
</pre>

<h2>Control Path</h2>
<h3>Buffer States</h3>
<p>We describe the state of the buffer itself as the number of items currently
 stored in the buffer, as indicated by the read and write addresses and
 their wrap-around bits. We only care about the extremes: if the buffer
 holds no items, or if it holds its maximum number of items, as explained
 above.</p>

<pre>
    reg stored_items_zero = 1'b0;
    reg stored_items_max  = 1'b0;

    always @(*) begin
        stored_items_zero = (buffer_read_addr == buffer_write_addr) && (buffer_read_addr_wrap_around == buffer_write_addr_wrap_around);
        stored_items_max  = (buffer_read_addr == buffer_write_addr) && (buffer_read_addr_wrap_around != buffer_write_addr_wrap_around);
    end
</pre>

<h3>Input Interface (Insert)</h3>
<p>The input interface is simple: if the buffer isn't at its maximum capacity,
 signal the input is ready, and when an input handshake completes, write the
 data directly into the buffer and increment the write address, wrapping
 around as necessary.</p>
<p>In Circular Buffer Mode, the input is always ready. If the buffer is full,
 we insert by ovewriting the second oldest value (in the buffer) as it is
 removed and placed into the output register (which held the oldest value).</p>

<pre>
    reg insert = 1'b0;

    always @(*) begin
        input_ready                             = (stored_items_max == 1'b0) || (CIRCULAR_BUFFER != 0);
        insert                                  = (input_valid      == 1'b1) && (input_ready  == 1'b1);

        buffer_wren                             = (insert == 1'b1);
        increment_buffer_write_addr             = (insert == 1'b1);
        load_buffer_write_addr                  = (increment_buffer_write_addr == 1'b1) && (buffer_write_addr == ADDR_LAST [ADDR_WIDTH-1:0]);
        toggle_buffer_write_addr_wrap_around    = (load_buffer_write_addr      == 1'b1);
    end
</pre>

<h3>Output Interface (Remove)</h3>
<p>The output interface is not so simple because the output is registered, and
 so holds data independently of the buffer. We signal the output holds valid
 data whenever we can remove an item from the buffer and load it into the
 output register. We meet this condition if the output register holds valid
 data and an output handshake completes, or if the buffer holds an item but
 the output register is not holding any valid data.  Also, we do not
 increment/wrap the read address if the previous item removed from the
 buffer and loaded into the output register was the last one.</p>
<p>In Circular Buffer Mode, if the buffer is full and we insert a new data
 value, perform a remove operation, discarding the contents of the output
 register and replacing it with the next oldest entry in the buffer, as if
 it had been read out.</p>

<pre>
    reg remove_normal           = 1'b0;
    reg remove_circular         = 1'b0;
    reg remove                  = 1'b0;
    reg output_leaving_idle     = 1'b0;
    reg load_output_register    = 1'b0;

    always @(*) begin
        remove_normal                       = (output_valid    == 1'b1) && (output_ready        == 1'b1);
        remove_circular                     = (CIRCULAR_BUFFER !=    0) && (stored_items_max    == 1'b1) && (insert == 1'b1);
        remove                              = (remove_normal   == 1'b1) || (remove_circular     == 1'b1);
        output_leaving_idle                 = (output_valid    == 1'b0) && (stored_items_zero   == 1'b0);
        load_output_register                = (remove          == 1'b1) || (output_leaving_idle == 1'b1);

        buffer_rden                         = (load_output_register       == 1'b1) && (stored_items_zero == 1'b0);
        increment_buffer_read_addr          = (load_output_register       == 1'b1) && (stored_items_zero == 1'b0);
        load_buffer_read_addr               = (increment_buffer_read_addr == 1'b1) && (buffer_read_addr  == ADDR_LAST [ADDR_WIDTH-1:0]);
        toggle_buffer_read_addr_wrap_around = (load_buffer_read_addr      == 1'b1);
    end

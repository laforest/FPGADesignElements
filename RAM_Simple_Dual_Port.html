<h1>Simple Dual-Ported RAM</h1>
<p>Defines a memory, of various implementation, with one write port and one
 read port (1W1R), separately addressed, with a common clock.  Common data
 width on both ports. <em>This is usually the fastest BRAM configuration when
 used with write-forwarding logic.</em>
 There is no synchronous clear on the output: In Quartus at least, any
 register driving it cannot be retimed, and it may not be as portable.
 Instead, use separate logic (e.g.: an <a href="./Annuller.html">Annuller</a>) to
 zero-out the output down the line.</p>
<h2>Write Forwarding</h2>
<p>The READ_NEW_DATA parameter control the behaviour of simultaneous reads and
 writes to the same address. This is the most important parameter when
 considering what kind of memory block the CAD tool will infer.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>READ_NEW_DATA = 0</code> describes a memory which returns the OLD value (in the
 memory) on coincident read and write (no write-forwarding).  This is
 well-suited for LUT-based memory, such as MLABs.</li>
<li><code>READ_NEW_DATA = 1</code> (or any non-zero value) describes a memory which
 returns NEW data (from the write) on coincident read and write, usually by
 inferring some surrounding write-forwarding logic.  Good for dedicated
 Block RAMs, such as M10K.</li>
</ul>
<p>The inferred write-forwarding logic also allows the RAM to operate at
 higher frequency, since a read corrupted by a simultaneous write to the
 same address will be discarded and replaced by the write value at the
 output mux of the forwarding logic. Otherwise, the RAM must internally
 perform the write on one edge of the clock, and the read on the other,
 which requires a longer cycle time.</p>
<h3>Quartus</h3>
<p>For Quartus, if you do not want write-forwarding, but still get the higher
 speed at the price of indeterminate behaviour on coincident read/writes,
 use "no_rw_check" as part of the RAMSTYLE (e.g.: "M10K, no_rw_check").
 Depending on the FPGA hardware, this may also help when returning OLD data.
 If that fails, add this setting to your Quartus project:
 <code>set_global_assignment -name ADD_PASS_THROUGH_LOGIC_TO_INFERRED_RAMS OFF</code>
 to disable creation of write-forwarding logic, as Quartus ignores the
 "no_rw_check" RAMSTYLE for M10K BRAMs.</p>
<h3>Vivado</h3>
<p>Vivado uses a different mechanism to control write-forwarding: set
 RW_ADDR_COLLISION to "yes" to force the inference of write forwarding
 logic, or "no" to prevent it. Otherwise, set it to "auto".</p>

    reg [WORD_WIDTH-1:0] ram [DEPTH-1:0];
</pre>

<p>The only difference selected by READ_NEW_DATA is the use of
 blocking/non-blocking assignments.  Blocking assignments make the write
 happen logically before the read, as ordered here, and thus describe
 write-forwarding behaviour where the read takes data from the write port.
 Non-blocking assignments make read and write take effect simultaneously at
 the end of the always block, so the read takes its data from the memory.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Since I originally wrote this code, over 10 years ago, I have
 learnt that using blocking assignments inside a clocked always block may
 cause simulation race conditions, depending on the order of evaluation of
 the always blocks (see IEEE Standard 1364-2001, Section 5, "Scheduling
 Semantics"). However, I have never seen such race conditions happen,
 possibly because of how this and other code was written (e.g.: it's in its
 own module, which affects event scheduling). I also could not find
 a simpler and cleaner way to express "write-before-read" behaviour while
 leaving the CAD tool free to infer RAM as it could. Finally, FPGA Block
 RAMs, and their CAD tools, have since changed and may no longer infer
 memory in the same way or have exactly the same supported behaviours in
 hardware.  This module should be sufficient for most purposes, but check
 your synthesis results! </p>

<p>If you are not using an init file, the following code will set all memory
 locations to INIT_VALUE. The CAD tool should generate a memory
 initialization file from that.  This is useful to cleanly implement small
 collections of registers (e.g.: via RAMSTYLE = "logic" on Quartus), without
 having to deal with an init file.  Your CAD tool may complain about too
 many for-loop iterations if your memory is very deep. Adjust the tool
 settings to allow more loop iterations.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the initialization file format is one value per line, one for
 each memory word from 0 to DEPTH-1, in bare hexadecimal (e.g.: 0012 to init
 a 16-bit memory word with 16'h12). Note that if your WORD_WIDTH isn't
 a multiple of 4, the CAD tool may complain about the width mismatch.
 You can base yourself on this Python <a href="./RAM_generate_empty_init_file.py">memory initialization file
 generator</a>.</p>

<pre>
    generate
        if (USE_INIT_FILE == 0) begin : gen_init_value
            integer i;
            initial begin
                for (i = 0; i < DEPTH; i = i + 1) begin
                    ram[i] = INIT_VALUE;
                end
            end
        end
        else begin : gen_init_file
            initial begin
                $readmemh(INIT_FILE, ram);
            end
        end
    endgenerate

<h1>System Design Standard</h1>

<p>from <a href="./index.html">FPGA Design Elements</a> by <a href="http://fpgacpu.ca/">Charles Eric LaForest, PhD.</a>

<p class="bordered"><i>This is a continually evolving document. Please send any

<p>Over time, I've found that most of the difficulty in FPGA system design
comes from a lack of modularity, not having a library of building blocks, and
from not using the logic optimization work done by the CAD tool to simplify
design.

<p>It matters to have a system design standard, since the implementation
<em>doesn't matter</em>. We want to think in terms of the design and its
blocks, and not concern ourselves (too much) with the implementation of these
blocks. Nonetheless, a block needs to be well-implemented and understood. I
describe related implementation practices in the companion <a
href="./verilog.html">Verilog Coding Standard</a>.

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>This standard mainly describes how to divide a digital design into parts,
including all the files required by the CAD tools which do not describe the
design itself. These parts aim to be reusable, easy to understand, and
cultivate a library of parts and design idioms.

<p>This standard <em>does not</em> define any specification, testing,
verification, validation, or documentation methodologies (though I hope you
have some!).

<p>Nor does this standard specify an implementation language, method or CAD
tool. However, it was written in tandem with a <a href="./verilog.html">Verilog
Coding Standard</a>.

<p>Finally, this standard assumes you are already familiar with digital design
in general. It is not a language or tool reference.

<h2>Modularization</h2>

Divide your design into modules to a very fine degree, even to the point of a
simple <a href="./Annuller.html">vector of AND gates</a>.
When a design is entirely composed of modules, the code expresses the design
itself rather than its implementation, and gives you multiple forms of
documentation and checking for free, and greater control over implementation.

<p>A module definition forms part of a <em>general</em> design intent and a
module instance, through its name, parameters, and connections, tells you the
<em>specific</em> design intent at that point in the design. Without extensive
modularization, unless the reader already knows the design, they have to
continually reverse-engineer the meaning of the logic back into the design.

<p>A design composed of modules, when successively viewed in the CAD tool as
elaboration, synthesis, and implementation schematics, allows you to check many
things:

<ul>

<li>The post-elaboration schematic gives you a block diagram view of your
source code, which allows you to more easily find missing connections and count
pipeline stages (and thus check their alignment).

<li>The post-synthesis schematic allows you to check that your code synthesizes
as you expect, and shows you the impact of logic optimizations: hardware will
disappear from a module or move from one module to another. If an entire module
vanishes, that may indicate a missing connection to that module which disabled
it.

<li>The post-place-and-route schematic (a.k.a. post-implementation) shows you
how the synthesized logic ends up on the FPGA, and is often annotated with
logic and interconnect delays. This view can also show you the critical path as
it flows from module to module, and that knowledge can feed back into the
architecture of your design.

</ul>

<p>Without modules, the schematics rapidly become a large mess of random logic,
which becomes increasingly hard to relate to the original code as you move from
elaboration to sythesis to implementation. Dividing a design into modules
preserves the logical design hierarchy (even though in hardware it is usually
all flattened).

<p class="bordered">Within each module, you only have to think about the
immediately relevant logic and wires, which give us the guiding principle for
modular decomposition of a design: <em>move unrelated connections into separate
modules</em>. If you have lines of logic with connections between them which
themselves do not connect to the surrounding logic, then those lines should be,
if possible, parameterized and encapsulated into a sub-module. Then, the other
connections in the surrounding logic are necessarily more closely related and
now encapsulated in the enclosing module.

<h3>Building Blocks</h3>

Use the modularization process to create a library of well-commented and tested
building blocks which will largely remove the need for random logic in most
cases, and document design knowledge for the future. 

<p>By adjusting the module parameters, setting some inputs constant, and
leaving some outputs unconnected, the CAD tool can optimize the general case
logic of a building block, while still keeping the design intent clear in the
source. A design then becomes a hierarchy of modules, connected by wires, and
any random logic signifies a very local and special case (e.g.: combining two
flags into one).

<p>These building blocks should be quite small, implementing logic functions
common to most any design: <a href="./index.html">FPGA Design Elements</a>.

<p>Using building blocks enables a better separation of control, processing,
and interface in your design.  Divide a sub-system into one module for
functionality (processing and storage), one for control (the FSM), and one for
interfacing to the rest of the system (memory-mapping the data storage and
configuration registers).

<h2>System Architecture</h2>

<p>In a project with multiple FPGAs and boards and connecting paths between
them, all designed by separate engineering teams, a common code architecture on
each FPGA makes managing various mismatches, errors, and last-minute changes
much easier, as well as improving portability. It also help single-FPGA designs
for the same reasons.

<p>I'll start explaining at the bottom and work upwards. Each higher layer
instantiates the one below it as a single module, and performs one specific
function to support that underlying module. As we move upwards, the functions
shift from creating and supporting the application logic to managing the
interface to the outside world: 

<ul>
<li>The Core and Instance modules deal with the application logic.
<li>The Adapter module interfaces the application logic to the specific FPGA device.
<li>The Shim module interfaces the FPGA to the specific PCB it's mounted on.
</ul>

<h3>Core</h3>

<p>The Core logic of the application contains all the parts needed in the
abstract, without concern for interface protocols, size of FPGA, number of
instances, etc... It may culminate in a single module or a few. The only
FPGA-specific parts are technology-mapping issues like which DSP or BRAM blocks
are used.  Other than porting to another FPGA family, this code should never
change.  For example, the core logic could contain the control and data paths
of a soft-CPU, and the building blocks for a network-on-chip, but all as a
library of parts.

<h3>Instance</h3>

<p>The Instance culminates in a single module which instantiates the Core
logic, and specifies the size and number of core logic modules, as well as all
the wiring between them. The Instance primarily deals with scaling the
Core logic to the specific FPGA device being used. For example, the instance
defines how many data paths a soft-CPU will have if it's a SIMD system, and how
many CPUs in total and the network-on-chip which connects them. There are still
no concerns about particular external interfaces: buses and clocks are simple
signals. 

<p>At this point, the design can be simulated to check for logical correctness,
and synthesized for a preliminary estimate of its final operating frequency,
assuming the instance is surrounded by a temporary test harness of registers to
ensure correct static timing analysis.

<a name="adapter"></a>

<h3>Adapter</h3>

<p>The Adapter instantiates the Instance, defines the final interface ports
expected by the board upon which the FPGA resides, and wires up the instance to
those ports. The Adapter adds any logic necessary to support the Instance and
also satisfy the FPGA CAD tools. For example, the Adapter will contain any
clock generation and management hardware, add any differential buffers to
signals that need it, even if unused, to satisfy CAD tool constraints, and
convert interface protocols as required (e.g.: as AXI leader/followers,
bi-directional or tri-state buffers, etc...).

<p>At this point, synthesis of the design should find any final errors, such as
insufficient clock buffers or logic resources, expose any missing/violated
constraints, and in general point out anything that needs attention. You
should, of course, fix things to minimize the number of warnings from the CAD
tool.

<h3>Shim</h3>

<p>The Shim instantiates the Adapter, and nothing else. It has the same
interface ports as the Adapter, and the Shim's ports are at the top level and
physically connect to the FPGA pins. What the Shim does, however, is handle the
problems that crop up with PCBs: unusable connections, schematic errors,
incompatible voltage standards, etc... For example, if some top-level pins are
unusable due to a design or manufacturing error, the Shim can shuffle the
signals between the top-level pins and the adapter ports so as to present a
uniform, maybe reduced, interface to the Adapter. If you have spare board pins,
this is where you use them. 

<p>Another example is where, due to how a PCB had been designed, the pins of a
bus were not connected to consecutive pins along the FPGA's I/O Banks,
scattering the bus (and it's associated logic) all over the device. The Shim
file translates the logical bus pins from the adapter to physically consecutive
pins on the device, which helped keep related logic grouped together.  Of
course, any other FPGA on the PCB needs a similar Shim file to re-organize the
now scrambled bus signals coming in.

<p>The Shim file is also a good place to annotate the top level pins: which
ones are clock-capable, are they usable as differential pairs, which clock
region or I/O Bank they reside in, etc... which helps future alterations.

<p>Finally, you now can do a full synthesis to get the final operating
frequency, do post-placement synthesis to check things like the I/O delay
lines, and do final floorplanning.

<h2>Project Constraints</h2>

<p>Divide different types of CAD tool constraints across different files,
leaving only a select few constraints applied directly in the source as
attributes on wires, registers, and modules. This keeps the design as portable
as possible and easy to manage when the underlying FPGA or the surrounding PCB
changes. Some constraint types to group into separate files include:

<ul>

<li>Bitstream and configuration, where you define pull-ups/downs on
configuration pins, what configuration interface is used (e.g.: SPI, parallel
port, JTAG, etc...), and bistream encryption.

<li>Logic placement, where you define floorplan regions and assign modules to
them. This is handy to isolate critical logic that needs to meet timing
reliably as the design grows (e.g.: DDR controllers), and to work around some
critical paths by physically separating modules which otherwise get placed too
close together and cause congested routing.

<li>Pin placement, where for each bank of device pins you give each pin a source code
name, an I/O standard, pull-ups/down, drive strengths, etc.. and make note of
which pins remain unused, or are particularly dangerous to the design if
misused or misconfigured. Grouping the pins by bank in device order also shows
you which signals physically adjacent to eachother on the device, which matters
for noise and switching current issues.

<li>Timing constraints, where you define the incoming clocks, their
synchronous/asynchronous relationships, any false paths, and external I/O
delays.

<li>Optimization constraints, which allow you to preserve logic against some
optimizations. For example, when you bring up a partially completed system
where some modules are dangling, or have incomplete connections, preventing
optimization on those modules (e.g.: via a <code>DONT_TOUCH</code> attribute
under Vivado) to keep any unused logic will give you a better ongoing estimate
of the final area and timing.

</ul>

<p>However, some of these constraints may have to be applied in the source code
itself, as the CAD tool may not read the other constraints files early enough
in the synthesis, placement, or routing phases. This really depends on the CAD
tool. And some constraints, like Vivado's <code>ASYNC_REG</code> which declares
registers as part of a clock domain crossing synchronizer, should be placed in
the CDC synchronizer module source code so they automatically take effect at
each CDC synchronizer module instantiation.

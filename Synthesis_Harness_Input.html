<h1>Synthesis Harness Input</h1>
<p>When developing a new module, it's very convenient to run it through your
 CAD tool by itself, on a smaller target FPGA, with any random automatic pin
 assignments, to iterate quickly and find synth and timing issues.
 However, you can run out of physical pins, and your logic will get
 scattered all over the FPGA as it tries to stay close to the pins, wrecking
 your timing estimates.  Also, any input or output logic which isn't
 registered won't be part of the STA (Static Timing Analysis), so that also
 makes the timing estimate less accurate when synthesized in isolation.</p>
<p>A solution to both problems is to place your design in a harness of
 registers. For the inputs, we feed them all from a shift register fed by
 only a few pins (clock, reset, enable, input, etc...), which virtually
 eliminates the problem of running out of pins, while still avoiding
 optimizing away any logic by accident since no inputs are constant or
 predictable. The inputs are meaningless for simulation, but that's not what
 we need them for right now.</p>
<p>You must also constrain the harness registers to <em>not</em> be placed in the
 FPGA I/O registers so they will cluster around your logic, which will now
 tend to place all together in the center of the FPGA, giving you
 a reasonnably accurate timing estimate. </p>
<p>You can make the timing estimate more conservative by logically partioning
 the netlists of the design and the harness so they do not retime into
 eachother. You can make the timing estimate <em>even more</em> conservative by
 additionally physically partitioning (a.k.a. floorplanning) the netlists:
 place your design into a floorplan rectangle (or let the CAD tool do it
 automatically) and exclude the harness, which will then cluster around the
 design floorplan and approximate either connection from adjacent
 floorplans, or logic forced apart by congestion.</p>
<p>A good way to use this module is to add up the widths of all your design
 inputs and use that sum as the <code>WORD_WIDTH</code> parameter, then connect
 a concatenation of all your input wires to the <code>word_out</code> port. The
 remaining harness ports can be connected to any suitable device pins.</p>

<h1>A Primer on Clock Domain Crossing (CDC) Theory</h1>

<p>from <a href="./index.html">FPGA Design Elements</a> by Charles Eric LaForest, PhD., <a href="../gateforge/index.html">GateForge Consulting Ltd.</a>

<p>You can design plain synchronous logic driven by a single clock and be
certain it'll work (and you'd be right)...or you can design Clock Domain
Crossing (CDC) logic, and always be full of doubt.  CDC logic is a
well-understood, but subtle design problem.  There are many ways to get it
slightly wrong, causing intermittent failures, or ending up with a design that
complicates things and reduces performance.

<h2>Defining Metastability</h2>

<p>Normally, digital logic works in a bistable mode: it's either in a high
state or low state, glossing over the fact that it takes time to move from one
state to the other.  But so long as we sample states (e.g.: latch a signal) far
from those transitions, the assumption holds and everything remains bistable.

<p>A <em>metastable</em> state is simply any state that is neither high nor
low, but in between, like during a transition. And the closer to the mid-point
between states a metastable state is, the longer it takes to resolve to a valid
state and the less certainty there is which valid state that will be.  So the
next logic output may remain metastable or resolve too late, a flip-flop may
sample the wrong state, and so on... and your system falls apart.

<p>Metastability can happen at clock domain crossings since the sending clock
and receiving clock are (usually) asynchronous to eachother, or at least is is
a lot simpler and robust to assume they are independent that way. Thus the
receiving clock might sample a signal from the sending clock domain too close
to its transitions, causing metastability.

<p><i>(And it's impossible to design metastability-free circuits. That would
imply instantaneous state transitions, which isn't physically possible.)</i>

<h2>The CDC Basic Building Block</h2>

<p>A <a href="./CDC_Synchronizer.html">CDC Synchronizer</a> forms the core of
any CDC solution: a chain of two (or more) closely placed registers, with no
logic between them, and clocked by the receiving clock.  The input register
receives a bit synchronized to a sending clock, and the output register sends a
version of that bit synchronized to the receiving clock. The duration between
bit transitions at the output may be of a different length than the original
bit, with a new duration of some multiple of the receiving clock period.

<h2>Latency</h2>

<p>Despite having two registers, a synchronizer has an unpredictable latency
from the point of view of the sending clock. A few different cases may happen,
which will also explain why a synchronizer is necessary:

<ol>

<li>The receiving clock captures the incoming bit properly, which then exits
the synchronizer on the next cycle. Latency: 2 cycles.

<li>The receiving clock captures the incoming bit just before a transition, so
that transition will pass through after two more cycles. Latency: 3 cycles.

<li>The receiving clock captures the incoming bit as it transitions, causing
the first register output to go metastable, which then settles into the correct
post-transition state and exits in the following cycle. Latency: 2 cycles.

<li>The receiving clock captures the incoming bit as it transitions, causing
the first register output to go metastable, which then settles into the
incorrect pre-transition state (no change). The post-transition bit is properly
captured in the next cycle, and exits in the cycle after that. Latency: 3
cycles.

<li>The receiving clock captures the incoming bit as it transitions, causing
the first register output to go metastable, which then settles into either the
pre-transition or post-transition state, <em>but takes too long</em>. The input
of the second register thus samples a metastable bit, causing one of the
previous two cases (3,4) to happen, or this case (5) again, at its own output.
However, this second metastability is <em>exponentially</em> less likely than
the first, and should in practice "never" happen (meaning, once every many,
many years on average, swamped by other failure modes).

</ol>

<p>Thus, depending on the alignment of the sending clock relative to the
receiving clock at that particular point in time, the output high and low
phases of a toggling bit may have different lengths, though the total period
remains the same.  Also, the synchronizer prevents metastable state from
propagating into the rest of the logic, possibly causing an incorrect bit value
to be created.

<p>The variable latency of a synchronizer implies an important design rule of
CDC: <b>only one bit at a time may ever be synchronized across a given clock
domain crossing.</b>  If you tried to synchronize two bits in parallel, or the same
bit twice in parallel, there would be no guarantee that both bits would always
see the same latency through the synchronizer. With only a single bit, the
worst case is that its transition is missed, and will get captured in the next
receiving clock cycle.  This delay causes no errors in itself, and only alters
the received bit duration by one receiving clock cycle.

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>How fast can we pass a bit through a synchronizer? The input bit needs to
remain stable long enough for the receiving clock to be always able to properly
capture the bit between two of its transitions (a cycle), else we could miss a
pulse. We can guarantee a proper capture if the minimum time between bit
transitions is equal or greater to 3 edges of the receiving clock, regardless
of clock alignment:

<ol>

<li>The 3 receiving clock edges are positive-negative-positive. Thus, if the
first posedge misses the first bit transition or goes metastable (see above),
the second one will capture the bit properly before the second transition.

<li>The 3 receiving clock edges are negative-positive-negative. Since the
posedge is squarely in the middle between the bit transitions, the bit is
properly sampled.

</ol>

<p>So, in the worst case of a bit which toggles each sending clock cycle, the
receiving clock must run at least 1.5x faster to provide 3 edges between bit
transitions. 

<p>This 1/3 sending/receiving ratio is another way to express the worst case
synchronizer latency of 3 cycles explained earlier: 3 receiving clock edges per
incoming bit transition means 6 edges total over a cycle (two transitions),
which necessarily contain 3 positive edges.

<p>This 1/3 ratio is a stiff penalty, but peripherals clocks are usually slower
than core logic clocks, and the penalty can be spread out over multiple bits by
receiving multiple bits in one clock domain and then passing the resulting
whole word across clock domains (directly, without synchronization!), with a
single "valid" bit being synchronized across clock domains and acting as a
latch trigger in the receiving clock domain.

<h2>Further Issues and Reading</h2>

<p>This article only scratches the surface of CDC, and glosses over accounting
for propagation delay, setup, and hold times when determining the maximum data
rate, or CAD tool issues regarding placement, timing analysis, and MTBF (Mean
Time Between Failure) calculations. Designing even simple CDC circuits requires
sweating a lot of details!

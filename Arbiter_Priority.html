<h1>A Priority Arbiter</h1>
<p>Returns a one-hot grant bitmask of the least-significant bit set in a word,
 where bit 0 can be viewed as having highest priority. <em>A grant is held
 until the request is released.</em></p>
<p>The requestors must raise and hold a <code>requests</code> bit and wait until the
 corresponding <code>grant</code> bit rises to begin their transaction. <em>Grants are
 calculated combinationally from the requests</em>, so pipeline as necessary.
 The highest priority pending and unmasked request is granted once the
 currently granted request is released.  The grant remains for as long as
 the request is held without interruption. Requesters can raise or drop
 their requests before their turn comes, but this must be done synchronously
 to the clock.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>A common use-case for an arbiter is to drive a <a href="./Multiplexer_One_Hot.html">one-hot
 multiplexer</a> to select one of multiple senders
 requesting for one receiver, or one of multiple receivers requesting from
 one sender. This arrangement requires that the requestors can raise and
 hold a <code>requests</code> bit, wait until they receive the correspondig <code>grant</code> bit
 to begin their transaction, and to drop their <code>requests</code> bit only once they
 are done.  This is very similar to a ready/valid handshake, except that the
 transaction cannot be interrupted, else the granted access is lost.</p>
<h2>Fairness</h2>
<p><strong>A Priority Arbiter is not fair:</strong> if a higher-priority request happens too
 frequently it will starve lower-priority requests, and if a lower-priority
 request holds its grant too long it will starve higher-priority requests,
 causing priority inversion. To distribute the grants fairly, you need
 a <a href="./Arbiter_Round_Robin.html">Round-Robin Arbiter</a>.</p>
<h3>Customizations</h3>
<p>To enable the creation of custom fairness adjustments, the <code>requests_mask</code>
 input can be used to exclude one or more requests from being granted in the
 current cycle, and must be updated synchronously to the <code>clock</code>. The
 <code>requests_mask</code> is arbitrary, and if desired can be calculated from the
 current <code>requests</code>, the <code>grant_previous</code> one-hot output which holds the
 <code>grant</code> from the previous clock cycle, and the current one-hot <code>grant</code>
 output.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since a grant typically lasts longer than one cycle and won't get granted
 again for several cycles, taking multiple cycles to compute the next
 <code>requests_mask</code> is a valid option.</li>
<li>The <code>requests_mask</code> is applied combinationally to the <code>requests</code> input
 and to the internal <code>grant_previous</code>, both of which have a combinational
 path to <code>grant</code>, so pipeline as necessary. </li>
</ul>
<p>If unused, leave <code>requests_mask</code> set to all-ones, and the masking logic
 will optimize away.</p>

<pre>
`default_nettype none

module <a href="./Arbiter_Priority.html">Arbiter_Priority</a>
#(
    parameter INPUT_COUNT = 0
)
(
    input   wire                        clock,
    input   wire                        clear,

    input   wire    [INPUT_COUNT-1:0]   requests,
    input   wire    [INPUT_COUNT-1:0]   requests_mask,  // Set to all-ones if unused.
    output  wire    [INPUT_COUNT-1:0]   grant_previous,
    output  wire    [INPUT_COUNT-1:0]   grant
);
</pre>

<p>If the request granted on the previous clock cycle is still active, hold it.
 Else, filter the requests, masking off any externally disabled requests
 (<code>requests_mask</code> bit is 0).
 Note that a granted request cannot be interrupted by clearing its mask bit. </p>

<pre>
    localparam INPUT_ZERO = {INPUT_COUNT{1'b0}};

    reg  [INPUT_COUNT-1:0] requests_masked = INPUT_ZERO;

    always @(*) begin
        requests_masked = ((requests & grant_previous) != INPUT_ZERO) ? grant_previous : (requests & requests_mask);
    end
</pre>

<p>Then, from the remaining requests, we further mask out all but the highest
 priority (lowest bit) set request and grant it.</p>

<pre>
    <a href="./Bitmask_Isolate_Rightmost_1_Bit.html">Bitmask_Isolate_Rightmost_1_Bit</a>
    #(
        .WORD_WIDTH (INPUT_COUNT)
    )
    priority_mask
    (
        .word_in    (requests_masked),
        .word_out   (grant)
    );
</pre>

<p>We must use the current grant to mask off all the other input requests so
 a grant cannot be interrupted by a higher priority request until the
 current granted request is released. We need a register here to avoid
 a combinational feedback path.</p>

<pre>
    <a href="./Register.html">Register</a>
    #(
        .WORD_WIDTH     (INPUT_COUNT),
        .RESET_VALUE    (INPUT_ZERO)
    )
    previously_granted_request
    (
        .clock          (clock),
        .clock_enable   (1'b1),
        .clear          (clear),
        .data_in        (grant),
        .data_out       (grant_previous)
    );

endmodule

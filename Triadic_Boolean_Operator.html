<h1>Triadic Boolean Operator (Dual Output)</h1>
<p>Computes one of the 256 possible three-variable (triadic) Boolean operations,
 selectable at run-time, on the <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>C</code> input words, with optional
 dual output.</p>
<p>We could implement a triadic Boolean operator in hardware the same way as
 we did the <a href="./Dyadic_Boolean_Operator.html">dyadic Boolean operator</a>, but
 with an 8:1 multiplexer instead of a 4:1 multiplexer. However, unlike a 4:1
 mux, an 8:1 mux doesn't fit into a 6-LUT on a modern FPGA, which distances
 our design from the underlying FPGA hardware: we might not be able to
 pipeline it as required for best operating speed, we are more at the mercy
 of the register retiming and logic packing of the CAD tool, and as we'll
 see, we lock ourselves out of a useful break in abstraction which gives
 a triadic operator special uses.</p>
<p>Instead, we can decompose a triadic Boolean function <code>f(A,B,C)</code> into two
 dyadic sub-functions based on the two possible values of <code>C</code>: <code>g(A,B)
 = f(A,B,0)</code> and <code>h(A,B) = f(A,B,1)</code>. We can then reconstruct the original
 triadic function like so: <code>f(A,B,C) = (g(A,B) &amp; ~C) | (h(A,B) &amp; C)</code>: the
 value of <code>C</code> selects one of the two dyadic Boolean functions of <code>A</code> and
 <code>B</code>.  Note that <code>C</code> selects bit-wise, not word-wise: each bit of <code>C</code>
 selects the corresponding bit of <code>g(A,B)</code> or <code>h(A,B)</code>.  This useful
 mathematical identity is known as "Shannon Decomposition" or "Boole's
 Expansion Theorem".</p>
<p>We can use a triadic operator to implement very diverse functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./Bit_Voting.html">Majority</a>: <code>AB | AC | BC</code>, which is used in Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR). </li>
<li><a href="./Bit_Voting.html">Minority</a>, which tells you if a TMR unit had a corrected error. </li>
<li>Given <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and their sum <code>A+B</code>, you can <a href="./CarryIn_Binary.html">recover the carries into each bit position</a> like so: <code>A ^ B ^ (A+B)</code>. This can allow you to find overflows in packed sub-word parallel arithmetic (e.g.: adding two 32-bit words as two vectors of 4 bytes) </li>
<li>Bitfield masking and swapping between <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, as selected by the bitmask <code>C</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When used to implement Boolean functions with 4 or more variables
 (tetradic or n-adic), triadic functions approximately halve the number of steps
 required compared to using ordinary dyadic functions. This is likely one
 reason the NVIDIA Maxwell GPUs implemented triadic Boolean functions with
 the <code>LOP3</code> instruction, and Intel CPUs with AVX-512 support with the
 <code>VPTERNLOG</code> instruction.</p>
<p>However, if you look at the implementation of <code>f(A,B,C)</code> above, we always
 throw away half of the total work done by both dyadic halves <code>g(A,B)</code> and
 <code>h(A,B)</code>.  Discarded work is a clue that we are missing out on some
 computational capacity or efficiency. So let's provide a way to output that
 discarded work. We can add a second output multiplexer, driven by the same
 functions <code>g(A,B)</code> and <code>h(A,B)</code>, but controlled by an inverted version of
 <code>C</code>, called <code>D</code>, which outputs the bits not selected by <code>C</code>. And, instead
 of hardcoding <code>D</code> as the inverse of <code>C</code>, we can control it with a 1-bit
 <code>dual</code> signal. If <code>dual</code> is not set, then <code>C</code> and <code>D</code> are the same, and
 both triadic outputs are identical.</p>
<p>With two outputs, our triadic Boolean operator can now do more. When <code>dual</code> is set:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can compute 2 independent <a href="./Dyadic_Boolean_Operations.html">dyadic Boolean functions</a>.</li>
<li>We can set <code>g(A,B)</code> and <code>h(A,B)</code> to always output <code>A</code> or <code>B</code>, and depending on <code>C</code>, send those outputs either straight through or crossed-over. This acts as a Banyan Switch, which is the building block of a lot of switching networks.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have not gone through the trouble of defining all 256 triadic Boolean
 operations, but given the <a href="./Dyadic_Boolean_Operations.html">definitions of the 16 possible dyadic Boolean
 operations</a>, you can easily create
 triadic definitions as needed: write out the 8-entry truth table for your
 desired triadic function, split the table into two 4-entry truth tables
 with the most-significant input bit (<code>C</code>, as above) always 1 in one table,
 and always 0 in the other, then use those two dyadic definitions as
 functions <code>g(A,B)</code> and <code>h(A,B)</code> as explained above.</p>
<p>You can, of course, repeat this process to implement tetradic or n-adic
 functions, but the <em>size</em> of the truth tables grows exponentially
 (2<sup>n</sup>), and the <em>number</em> of truth tables grows super-exponentially
 (65,536 possible tetradic functions, or 2<sup>2<sup>n</sup></sup> for
 n-adic functions), so there are increasingly fewer functions of general
 interest in that space, with some exceptions such as <a href="./Bit_Reducer.html">bit
 reductions</a> and <a href="./Word_Reducer.html">word reductions</a>.</p>

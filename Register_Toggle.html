<h1>A Toggle Register</h1>
<p>A synchronous <a href="./Register.html">Register</a> with a little extra logic to make
 it toggle. While <code>clock_enable</code> is high, each cycle <code>toggle</code> is high the
 output of the register will invert itself, regardless of the <code>data_in</code>
 input. If <code>toggle</code> is low, this module behaves like an ordinary register. </p>
<h2>How It Affects The Design Process</h2>
<p>It seems like overhead to have such trivial function as a distinct module,
 but if the extra 2:1 multiplexer and inverter on a feedback path from the
 output to the input was part of a larger circuit, its purpose would be
 obscured by other logic, or it would itself obscure the other logic. Thus,
 the user then has to reverse-engineer the implementation back to the
 intended function: a simple toggle, and further separate <em>that</em> function
 from the rest of the logic.</p>
<p>It is much less mental effort to encounter a module that states "I am
 a toggle", which then makes the surrounding logic simpler and more
 meaningful. And because the initial design process and later comprehension
 of the design both need less mental effort, we can claim such a module fits
 our way of thinking and that we will very likely find a need for it in
 multiple future designs.</p>
<h2>Function and Uses</h2>
<p>It is useful to imagine a toggle register, when holding a single bit, as
 a tiny finite state machine (FSM) with two states and transitions defined
 by the logic controlling the module inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>clear</code>, to bring the FSM to the start state,</li>
<li><code>clock_enable</code>, to control when transitions can happen,</li>
<li><code>data_in</code>, to force the FSM into a given, <em>data-dependent</em> state,</li>
<li><code>toggle</code>, to change to the other state without having to know which of
 the two states the FSM is currently in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Toggling can transform events denoted by the <em>presence</em> of a signal into
 events denoted by a <em>change</em> in a signal, such as when performing a 2-phase
 handshake between systems which are asynchronous to eachother. Or just to
 divide a pulse train by 2 or its multiples. Or by chaining multiple toggles
 to form a basic incrementing counter without using an adder, and so you can
 place logic between each counter bit to modulate it.</p>

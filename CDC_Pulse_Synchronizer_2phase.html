<h1>Clock Domain Crossing (CDC) Pulse Synchronizer (2-phase handshake)</h1>
<p>Reliably passes a synchronous posedge pulse from one clock domain to
 another when we don't know anything about the relative clock frequencies or
 the pulse duration. <em>Uses a 2-phase asynchronous handshake.</em></p>
<p>The recommended input is a single-cycle pulse in the sending clock domain.
 The output pulse is a single-cycle pulse in the receiving clock domain.</p>
<div class="bordered">

 For comparison, have a look at the [4-phase handshake Pulse
 Synchronizer](./CDC_Pulse_Synchronizer_4phase.html). It has slightly
 simpler hardware, but a more complex handshake leading to double the
 latency across clock domains, so it can only accept input pulses at half
 the maximum rate of this 2-phase implementation. 

 </div>

<h2>Theory of Operation</h2>
<p>We can't simply use a <a href="./CDC_Bit_Synchronizer.html">CDC Synchronizer</a> to
 pass a pulse of unknown duration between clock domains of unknown relation,
 as the receiving clock may not be able to sample the pulse correctly. So,
 we solve this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>first using the incoming pulse to toggle a register and disable
 further toggles,</li>
<li>synchronizing the output of that toggle register into the receiving clock domain,</li>
<li>using that synchronized toggle signal to generate a pulse (on any toggle
 edge) in the receiving clock domain,</li>
<li>synchronizing that toggle signal back into the sending clock domain,</li>
<li>using that synchronized toggle signal to re-enable the toggle register</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the initial signal and its response both reach the same value, the
 system is back into one of its two rest states, ready to receive another
 input pulse. This process of toggling a signal, then waiting for the
 response to also toggle into the same state, is a 2-phase asynchronous
 handshake. It does not depend on the timing of the signals, only their
 sequence.</p>
<h2>Input Pulse Frequency Limit</h2>
<p>The time taken for the 2-phase handshake to complete puts an upper limit on
 the input pulse rate, that also depends on the receiving clock frequency.
 If we exceed this rate, input pulses will be lost, as the input toggle
 register will have not been re-enabled yet.</p>
<p>At the upper limit, when the receiving clock frequency is fast enough to be
 "infinite" from the point of view of the sending clock (i.e.: the handshake
 response arrives soon enough within a single cycle of the sending clock to
 meet setup timing), then we only need to sum up the latencies on the sending
 clock side:</p>
<ol>
<li>Toggling the input register (and disabling it): 1 cycle</li>
<li>CDC into the receving clock domain: 0 cycles</li>
<li>CDC back into the sending clock domain: 3 cycles (worst case)</li>
<li>The input toggle register is now re-enabled and can receive a new input
 pulse..</li>
</ol>
<p>Since re-enabling the toggle register and receiving an input pulse can
 happen in the same cycle, there must be <em>at an absolute minimum</em> 3 idle
 sending clock cycles between input pulses, or one input pulse every 4th
 sending clock cycle.  Fortunately, we don't have to compute inter-pulse
 delays for every possible sending to receiving clock frequency ratio
 a system will encounter. The toggle register enabling logic also acts as
 a <code>ready</code> output on the sending side by noting when both the initial
 sending level and the returned response are at the same value, denoting
 a system at rest ready for the next 2-phase handshake.</p>

<pre>
`default_nettype none

module <a href="./CDC_Pulse_Synchronizer_2phase.html">CDC_Pulse_Synchronizer_2phase</a>
#(
    parameter CDC_EXTRA_DEPTH   = 0
)
(
    input   wire    sending_clock,
    input   wire    sending_pulse_in,
    output  reg     sending_ready,

    input   wire    receiving_clock,
    output  wire    receiving_pulse_out
);
</pre>

<p>Cleanup the input pulse to a single cycle pulse, so we cannot have
 a situation where the 2-phase handshake has completed and a long input pulse
 is still high, causing a second toggle and thus a second pulse in the
 receiving clock domain.</p>
<p>NOTE: It's possible to replace the Pulse_Generator with a a couple of AND
 and NOT gates, but this saves no logic (only a register), and makes this
 part of the design much harder to understand.</p>

<pre>
    wire cleaned_pulse_in;

    <a href="./Pulse_Generator.html">Pulse_Generator</a>
    pulse_cleaner
    (
        .clock              (sending_clock),
        .level_in           (sending_pulse_in),
        .pulse_posedge_out  (cleaned_pulse_in),
        // verilator lint_off PINCONNECTEMPTY
        .pulse_negedge_out  (),
        .pulse_anyedge_out  ()
        // verilator lint_on  PINCONNECTEMPTY
    );
</pre>

<p>Now use that single-cycle pulse to toggle a register, signalling the start
 of a 2-phase asynchronous handshake. We feed the output back to the input
 to keep the register output static when not toggling.</p>
<p>NOTE: <code>clear</code> cannot be used here: if the toggle register happens to have
 a high output, and we clear it, this will start a spurious 2-phase
 handshake and generate a spurious pulse in the receiving clock domain. Even
 if we could guarantee that the logic in both the sending and receiving
 clock domains would be cleared together, we can't be sure when each clear
 will take effect, and so the spurious pulse could have side-effects.</p>

<pre>
    wire toggle_response;
    reg  enable_toggle = 1'b0;
    wire sending_toggle;

    <a href="./Register_Toggle.html">Register_Toggle</a>
    #(
        .WORD_WIDTH     (1),
        .RESET_VALUE    (1'b0)
    )
    start_handshake
    (
        .clock          (sending_clock),
        .clock_enable   (enable_toggle),
        .clear          (1'b0),
        .toggle         (cleaned_pulse_in),
        .data_in        (sending_toggle),
        .data_out       (sending_toggle)
    );
</pre>

<p>When the toggle and its response have the same value, the 2-phase handshake
 is complete and we are ready to toggle again.</p>

<pre>
    always @(*) begin
        enable_toggle = (sending_toggle == toggle_response);
        sending_ready = enable_toggle;
    end
</pre>

<p>Pass the toggle signal to the receiving clock domain</p>

<pre>
    wire receiving_toggle;

    <a href="./CDC_Bit_Synchronizer.html">CDC_Bit_Synchronizer</a>
    #(
        .EXTRA_DEPTH        (CDC_EXTRA_DEPTH)
    )
    to_receiving
    (
        .receiving_clock    (receiving_clock),
        .bit_in             (sending_toggle),
        .bit_out            (receiving_toggle)
    );
</pre>

<p>Now pass the synchronized toggle signal back to the sending clock domain to
 signal that the CDC is complete and to re-enable the toggle register.</p>

<pre>
    <a href="./CDC_Bit_Synchronizer.html">CDC_Bit_Synchronizer</a>
    #(
        .EXTRA_DEPTH        (CDC_EXTRA_DEPTH)
    )
    to_sending
    (
        .receiving_clock    (sending_clock),
        .bit_in             (receiving_toggle),
        .bit_out            (toggle_response)
    );
</pre>

<p>Finally, convert the receiving toggle to a pulse in the receiving clock domain.
 We generate an output pulse on either of the toggle transitions.</p>

<pre>
    <a href="./Pulse_Generator.html">Pulse_Generator</a>
    receiving_toggle_to_pulse
    (
        .clock              (receiving_clock),
        .level_in           (receiving_toggle),
        // verilator lint_off PINCONNECTEMPTY
        .pulse_posedge_out  (),
        .pulse_negedge_out  (),
        // verilator lint_on  PINCONNECTEMPTY
        .pulse_anyedge_out  (receiving_pulse_out)
    );

endmodule
